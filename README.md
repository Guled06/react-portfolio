# React Portfolio

# Description:

This is my react portfolio. I created a react app to create my portfolio. I have used several installation, such as typed.js, bootstrap, jquery, node-sass, lightbox2, react-typed and normalize.css to make this application work. My React Portfolio will be far more dynamic than my previous updated portfolio where I did not use react. There is a stark difference between this portfolio and my previous updated portfolio. My react portfolio contains numerous files and folders that are interconnected. These series of connections creates the functionality of my portfolio. 

I have added six sreenshots of six applications I have built over the course of three months. I have also included the links of the applications in the portfolio. Each application that I have displayed will have two links, a link to the deployed application and a link to the GitHub repository.
